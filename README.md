# Simulation of a Complex Urban Traffic Flow System

## Project Overview

This project is an agent-based simulation model designed to analyze and optimize traffic flow within a virtual city environment. The simulation provides a controlled platform to test and evaluate the impact of various traffic management strategies and infrastructure changes, offering data-backed recommendations to improve efficiency and reduce congestion.

The project demonstrates strong **modeling**, **simulation**, and **data analysis** skills, showing a robust understanding of how to build and interpret complex systems.

## Key Features

- **Agent-Based Modeling:** Each vehicle is an independent agent with its own rules and behaviors, allowing for the simulation of complex, emergent traffic patterns.
- **Parameter-Driven Simulation:** The model can be configured with different parameters (e.g., number of vehicles, road length, traffic rules) to simulate a variety of scenarios.
- **Comprehensive Data Analysis:** The simulation outputs detailed data on vehicle speeds, travel times, and queue lengths, which are then analyzed to identify critical bottlenecks.
- **Evidence-Based Recommendations:** The analysis provides quantitative data to support recommendations for improving traffic flow, such as adjusting signal timings or adding new lanes.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Libraries:** Pandas (for data analysis), Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)

## Installation & Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/traffic-simulation.git](https://github.com/your-username/traffic-simulation.git)
    cd traffic-simulation
    ```

2.  **Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the simulation:**
    ```bash
    python traffic_simulation.py
    ```
    The simulation will run and print key metrics to the console. You can modify the parameters within the script to customize the simulation.

## Contributing

I'm open to contributions to expand the simulation's complexity, such as adding traffic lights, public transport, or more sophisticated driver behaviors.
